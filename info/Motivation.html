<h1>LAST DIALOGUE</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<div>
    <p>This work addresses the development of the theory utilizing the scientific research method. By applying Foucault’s archaeology method, the history and discourse of heat death theory are studied. Back to the birth of the theory’s concept, research aimed at digging out how the discourse was formed, what concepts are related and how it developed into a system.  Based on the model of power-knowledge, other research is made to figure out the practice of heat death theory in both science and sociology level. The interpretation of the laws of the universe and energy influences human behavior and judgement. Last Dialogue offers simulation and visualization to describe how a scientific theory develops, as well as the rules and interaction between the scientific theory and society.
<br><br><br>
Human beings spare no effort and spend thousands of years till they die in exploring how the world works though nothing will affect the universe. One theory system after another exists in history. The loop of science theory never terminates. The desire of understanding the destiny of the universe never disappears.  </p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Text:<br><br>
    Present the dialogue (monologue) that the consciousness talks.
    <br><br>  <br>
    Sound:<br><br>
    Simulate the response from black hole. Map the data chart of black hole mass and black hole spin to music score notation.
    <br><br>  <br>
    Animation:<br><br>

    First Stage: (The concept of entropy)<br>
    The animation applies a part of homo sapiens SOX1 gene data to form the origin DNA. As adding mechanical work in the system (click the mouse by the viewer), the entire entropy in the universe (as an isolated system)will increase. Therefore, the DNA will change into a loose arrangement as the system becomes more disorderly. The reason to use DNA is that after the birth of entropy in thermodynamics, this concept soon expanded to other fields like cosmology, information science and daily life. This concept is connected to our society firmly these days. Because of its power-knowledge function, it is quoted frequently to discuss why creatures die, why society and civilization collapse, and the direction of the time process, even in the wrong way.
    <br><br>
    Second Stage: (Heat death of the universe)<br>
    The animation demonstrates the process of heat death of the universe by moving the mouse from left to right. Entropy turns to the maximum and all the molecular motions are stopped. The universe is now at the status of thermal equilibrium. The estimated time of the process is provided at the bottom.
    <br><br>
    Third Stage: (Debates and Development)<br>
    After the birth of heat death, countless discussions and debates are raised. The pattern of data visualization shows the frequency of the usage of “heat death” from 1800 to 2019. The map behind presents the main researches and development on this topic in a geographic view.  The concept and worldview constructed in mind affected people’s judgment and actions, just as thermodynamics and Darwinism influenced the entire Victorian era.
    <br><br>
    Fourth Stage: (The Big Bang Theory)<br>
    The animation simulates the dynamic scene of the Big Bang. The color chosen is based on Hubble's law of redshift, which indicates that the spectrum of an astronomical object in a far distance toward longer wavelengths (reder).

    Background Picture:<br><br>
    Each part of the black hole. The pictures are arranged in the order of absorbing photon. The black hole image created refers to the black hole at the centre of galaxy M87.

    Maps:<br><br>
    Map the timeline of the development of theory / debates on the geography map.<br><br>
