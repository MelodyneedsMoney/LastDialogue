<h1>LAST DIALOGUE</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>Last Dialogue is a project about a narrative fantasy of communing with the universe.
    Before the extinction of human beings, humans created an independent collective consciousness storing the entire civilization and aimed at exploring the fate of the universe. The consciousness floating in the universe witnesses the stellar death and the development of the universe alone for an extremely long time. Only black holes exist now (estimated 10^90 year). The consciousness floats near the black hole and starts to be absorbed. It tells the history of the Anthropocene to the black hole as the last dialogue.
   <br><br><br>
    The main part of the project analyses the theory of Heat Death of the Universe, which is one of the supposed theories about the ultimate destiny of the universe. Simulation and visualization are utilized for presenting the concepts, data and social influence. The analysis is displayed in an interactive website, within the text-animation-sound format.
